Contains PicoJig-WL and PicoJig  　　
  
**PicoJig-WL**    
The microcontroller board uses Raspberry Pi Pico W. This is firmware and a PC application that controls the GPIO/UART/SPI/I2C/ADC/PWM of Pico W from a PC via Wi-Fi (TCP socket communication) or USB (virtual COM).

-Features   
*By sending commands from the PC app to Pi Pico W via Wi-Fi or USB, you can have Pi Pico W send any UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO/PWM data.       
*The UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO/ADC data received by Pi Pico W is passed to the PC app via W-Fi or USB and displayed on the PC app.     
*The Wi-Fi mode in the image below requires a wireless LAN router that supports the 2.4 GHz band Wi-Fi standard "IEEE 802.11b/g/n".     
*The SPI/I2C on Pi Pico W is on the master side. ・The source code for the PC app (a Windows app created in C#) is open to the public.     
  
**PicoJig**        
The microcontroller board uses a Raspberry Pi Pico. Compared to the PicoJig-WL, it does not have Wi-Fi functionality.
